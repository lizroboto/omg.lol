# Matrix

For the past couple of years, omg.lol hosted a Matrix homeserver for our members. Sadly, **the omg.lol Matrix homeserver will shut down on April 30, 2025**.

Matrix is a technically sophisticated federated chat protocol, but, frankly, it’s also a major _pain in the ass_. While its design is elegant in many ways, in practice it often feels like an unwieldy mess. It can be devastatingly resource-intensive, especially when doing something as simple as trying to join a large chat room somewhere. And it is also notoriously buggy, with experience-breaking glitches that have no clear path to resolution. The server requires constant maintenance and attention, to the point where it has consumed a disproportionate amount of time and resources within the omg.lol ecosystem. It’s not really sustainable.

We’ve puttered along with this setup for a while, duct-taping the cracks in the walls and bailing the rising flood waters as best we could, but we ultimately ran into the “final boss” of technical hurdles when we lost the ability to reliably add new people to the homeserver due to a glitch with the way Spaces operate.

So, it’s time to bid farewell to this interesting (but weird (and frustrating)) slice of the omg.lol tech stack. The Matrix server will remain operational through April for the handful of people who are still using it, but new accounts are no longer being provisioned.

[IRC](/info/irc), [XMPP](/info/xmpp), and [Discord](/info/discord) remain available for staying plugged into the omg.lol community with real-time chat, along with [Discourse](https://discourse.lol) and [Mastodon](/info/mastodon) for less synchronous stuff.

While our usage of the Matrix server is exceptionally low compared to the other chat platforms we offer, I do recognize the disruption that this causes to those who use it regularly. Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:help@omg.lol) if you have any questions, comments, or need help with anything related to the change.
