# Mastodon

We run a Mastodon instance on [social.lol](https://social.lol), and all omg.lol members are welcome to join. You can create a new account on your address’s social.lol page (click on your address, and then click the button in the “social.lol” section).

If you’re not familiar with Mastodon, you can [read all about it here](https://joinmastodon.org).

You can follow us (well, Prami) on Mastodon at [@prami@social.lol](https://social.lol/@prami).

We fully commit to all points of the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant).

## Instance details

We run the [stock Mastodon software](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases). When new (non-beta) versions are released, social.lol is upgraded within 24 hours.

We don’t modify the source code in any way or run any patches or extensions; this ensures that our instance is healthy and fully compatible with other instances.

We publish [a list of moderated servers](https://social.lol/about) which can be viewed when logged into the instance.

## If your omg.lol address expires

If your omg.lol address expires, you’ll have 14 days to export your data and migrate your Mastodon account to another instance.

After 14 days, your Mastodon account will be defederated and all data will be deleted in a GDPR-compliant manner. At that point, the social.lol account will become available to the next person who purchases that particular omg.lol address.
