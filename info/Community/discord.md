# Discord

We have a Discord “server”, if you’re into that sort of thing. It’s just for omg.lol members, though, so there’s no invite link. Instead, you can head on over to your address’s social.lol page and click the button there to be added to the server.

The [chat channels](/info/chat) on the server are bridged, so you’ll be able to chat with people who are on [IRC](/info/irc) and [XMPP](/info/xmpp). We also have a voice channel if you’d like to chat in 3D.
